<i>after John Cage</i><br>

1. only ask the questions to which you really need answers<br>

2. demonstrate uncertainty<br>

3. reconstruct for your students your own previous errors of thought and elucidate to your students what factors lead to a changed mind<br>

4. do not let the terms with which you understand the world get in the way of understanding it<br>

5. give up any desire to be the smartest person in the room<br>

6. remember that students have bodies and that bodies require movement, sustenance, rest, and relief<br>

7. leave an inheritance of dialectic <br>

8. preserve and sustain whatever delusions youâ€™ve found necessary to behave in good faith<br>

9. every student is a genius<br>

10. do not be afraid to state the obvious<br>

11. a socratic bully is still a bully<br>

12. thoroughly prepare class, including making preparations to abandon your preparations entirely<br>

13. listen with your body<br>

14. suspect charisma<br>

15. conduct yourself in such a way that your students can eventually forget that you exist<br>
