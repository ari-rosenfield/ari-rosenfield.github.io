Hi! I'm a Ph.D. candidate in the math department at University of California, Irvine. My thesis advisor is <a href="https://www.math.uci.edu/~mreyes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Manny Reyes.</a> Currently, I spend a lot of my mathematical life trying to apply category-theoretic techniques and language to the study of noncommutative algebra, noncommutative geometry, and quantum information. 
<br>
Before I was a mathematician, I worked as: A rural mail carrier, a salmon-cannery worker, a deli-counter meat-slicer, a server at a sandwich shop and an Indian buffet, a nightclub bathroom attendant, a Hebrew school teacher, the person who runs the balloon pop game at Pacific Park, a telemarketer, and a street accordionist. <br />

Lickorish's <b><i>An Introduction to Knot Theory</i></b>.</p><p> I am an introduction to mathematical Knot Theory; the theory of knots and links of simple closed curves in three-dimensional space. I consist of a selection of topics which graduate students have found to be a successful introduction to the field. Three distinct techniques are employed;  Geometric Topology Manoeuvres, Combinatorics, and Algebraic Topology.</p><p>Which Springer GTM would <i>you</i> be? <a href="http://math.jhu.edu/~savitt/GTM.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Springer GTM Test</a></p></td></tr></table>
