Hi! I'm a Ph.D. candidate in the math department at University of California, Irvine. My thesis advisor is <a href="https://www.math.uci.edu/~mreyes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Manny Reyes.</a> Currently, I spend a lot of my mathematical life thinking about enriched categories, toposes, and categorical quantum theory. Before I was a mathematician, I worked as: A rural mail carrier, a fish sorter in a salmon cannery, a server at a sandwich shop, a nightclub bathroom attendant, the person who runs the balloon pop game at Pacific Park, a telemarketer, and a street accordionist.
